# Rust on Web with Yew

I followed <https://yew.rs/docs/tutorial>

This works on my computer with `trunk serve --open` but idk if it will work on github pages.

I did `trunk build --release` but this doesn't work with python http server. I'm just going to commit the code and see if it works or not.
